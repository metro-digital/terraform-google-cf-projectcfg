# We enforce commit message standards via pre-commit in addition to this GitHub Action workflow because pre-commit only
# validates commit messages during the creation of a new commit. This enforcement point doesn't exist when validating
# the changes in our pre-commit GitHub Action workflow. Therefore, we explicitly run the commitlint GitHub Action which
# enforces commit message structures for already created commits.
