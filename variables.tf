    List of GCP enabled services / APIs to enable. Dependencies will be enabled automatically.

    **Remark**: Google sometimes changes (mostly adding) dependencies and will activate those automatically for your

    option to be authoritative for this reason. By default we are partly authoritative. This can can be controlled
    by the `enabled_services_disable_on_destroy` flag.

    Example:
    ```
    enabled_services = [
      "bigquery.googleapis.com",
      "compute.googleapis.com",
      "cloudscheduler.googleapis.com",

    Defaults to true. May be useful in the event that a project is long-lived but the infrastructure running in

    Can result in failing terraform runs if the removed service is a dependency for any other active service.

variable "service_accounts" {
  description = <<-EOD
    Service accounts to create for this project.

    **`display_name`:** Human-readable name shown in Google Cloud Console

    **`description` (optional):** Human-readable description shown in Google Cloud Console

    **`iam` (optional):** IAM permissions assigned to this Service Account as a *resource*. This defines which principal
    can do something on this Service Account. An example: If you grant `roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin` to a group
    here, this group will be able to maintain Service Account keys for this specific SA. If you want to allow this SA to
    use BigQuery, you need to use the project-wide `roles` input or, even better, use the `project_roles` attribute to
    do so.

    **`project_roles` (optional):** IAM permissions assigned to this Service Account on *project level*.
    This parameter is merged with whatever is provided as the project's IAM policy via the `roles` input.

    **`iam_non_authoritative_roles` (optional):** Any role given in this list will be added to the authoritative policy
    with its current value as defined in the Google Cloud Platform. Example use case: Composer 2 adds values to
    `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` binding when an environment is created or updated. Thus, you might want to
    automatically import those permissions.

    **`runtime_service_accounts` (optional):** You can list Kubernetes Service Accounts within Cloud Native Runtime
    clusters here. For details on the format, see the example below. A Workload Identity Pool and a Workload Identity
    Provider needed for Workload Identity Federation will be created automatically. Each service account given gains
    permissions to authenticate as this service account using Workload Identity Federation. This allows workloads running
    in Cloud Native Runtime clusters to use this service account without the need for service account keys. A detailed
    example can be found within the [FAQ].

    **`github_action_repositories` (optional):** You can list GitHub repositories (format: `user/repo`) here.
    A Workload Identity Pool and a Workload Identity Provider needed for Workload Identity Federation will be
    created automatically. Each repository given gains permissions to authenticate as this service account using
    Workload Identity Federation. This allows any GitHub Action pipeline to use this service account without the need
    for service account keys. An example can be found within the [FAQ].

    For more details, see the documentation for Google's GitHub action for authentication:
    [`google-github-actions/auth`](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth).

    **Remark:** If you configure `github_action_repositories`, the module binds a member for each repository to the role
    `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` inside the service account's IAM policy. This is done *regardless of whether
    or not* you list this role in the `iam_non_authoritative_roles` key. The same happens if you use
    `runtime_service_accounts`. A member per runtime service account is added to the service account's IAM policy.

    **Remark:** You need to grant the role `roles/iam.workloadIdentityPoolAdmin` to the principal that is
    executing the terraform code (most likely a service account used in a pipeline) if you plan to use
    `github_action_repositories` or `runtime_service_accounts`.

    Example:
    ```
      service_accounts = {

          description   = "Workload running in Cloud Native Runtime Cluster"
